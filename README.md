- `pubsub-onchain`
  - Actively maintained repository:
    [https://github.com/lsd-ucsc/decent-pubsub-onchain](https://github.com/lsd-ucsc/decent-pubsub-onchain)
  - This directory contains the source code for the Publisher, Subscriber, and Broker contracts.
- `revoker-onchain`
  - Actively maintained repository:
    [https://github.com/lsd-ucsc/decent-revoker-onchain](https://github.com/lsd-ucsc/decent-revoker-onchain)
  - This directory contains the source code for the revoker contracts.
- `Ethereum`
  - Actively maintained repository:
    [https://github.com/lsd-ucsc/DecentEthereum](https://github.com/lsd-ucsc/DecentEthereum)
  - This directory contains the source code for the Ethereum client,
    which acts as an off-chain broker introduced in our paper.
- `Revoker`
  - Actively maintained repository:
    [https://github.com/lsd-ucsc/DecentRevoker](https://github.com/lsd-ucsc/DecentRevoker)
  - This directory contains the source code for the off-chain revocation list
    monitor.
- `libs` contains all the libraries needed to compile the programs and contracts.
  It also contains helper programs to deploy contracts on the EVM-compatible
  networks.
  Here, we will be highlighting some of the important libraries:
  - `ra-onchain`:
    - Actively maintained repository:
      [https://github.com/lsd-ucsc/decent-ra-onchain](https://github.com/lsd-ucsc/decent-ra-onchain)
    - This library contains the smart contracts for on-chain parsing and
      verification of the Decent Self-Attestation certificates generated by
      enclaves.
  - `PyEthHelper` and `PyEthHelper2`:
    - Actively maintained repository:
      [https://github.com/lsd-ucsc/PyEthHelper](https://github.com/lsd-ucsc/PyEthHelper)
    - This is the helper program that interacts with the Ethereum network via
      JSON-RPC over HTTP.
      It is used to deploy contracts, send transactions, and call contract
      functions.
